		<p><strong> What is The Wishing Well?<br></strong>
		<em> The Wishing Well </em> is a digital version of the beloved classic.
		In a real wishing well, you cast a hope and a coin, and wait for results. 
		We've just modernized the concept.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Where does the money go?<br></strong>
		Any money in the well will be collected at the end of the day and donated to the Make A Wish Foundation.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Wait, I can take money from the well?<br></strong>
		Sure! As we said, our goal was to replicate a real wishing well. 
		There's never anything stopping you from taking a coin from a real wishing well either, except that people are watching.
		Here, your name will appear whenever you take or leave any money, but just to those who are watching. We don't record the information.
		Just know that if you do take money,<strong> it will not be donated to the Make A Wish Foundation.</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>So... what's the point?</strong><br>
		The purpose of <em>The Wishing Well</em> is twofold.<br>
		Firstly, The well allows you to share your heart's desire, focusing your dreams and optimism for the future,
		all from the comfort of your own home. It serves the same purpose as a real wishing well, but for the modern era.<br>
		Secondly, the well serves as a social experiment. There are dozens of theories about how people interact on the internetâ€”
		It's still being widely discussed. Many believe that anonymity brings out the worst in people Maybe that's true. But people don't often
		take coins from real wishing wells. This project allows us to analyze how often people give verses take, how much people are donating,
		and, in general, how people behave when something with established social norms is transformed to a medium where they are blurry at best.</p>
